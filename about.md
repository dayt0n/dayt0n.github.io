I have been developing and **really** exploring iOS for about a year. That is half of the time I have had an iOS device. I will be creating a post explaining my experience with iOS and OS X later.

###Projects
I am currently working on a downgrade for any `limera1n` devices. Other than that, you can find any project I have ever created or helped with on my [GitHub](http://github.com/dayt0n). Here is a list if you are interested: 

* **AppPirate**, a program for iOS that installs unsigned applications.
* **SSHLock**, a commandline utility for iOS to lock a device; even remotely if you wanted.
* **CyDelete**, a Cydia tweak to delete installed packages from SpringBoard.
* **Cydia8Install**, a utility to install Cydia onto jailbroken devices without it.
* **BackupRestore**, just a simplified libimobiledevice.
* **USBTCP**, mainly used to track YikYak posts or any other "anonymous" applications.
* **relwvm**, a utility to edit lwvm blocks and potentially dualboot an iOS device.
* **idevicerestore**, a utility to restore a device without the need for iTunes.
* **DeviceInfo**, makes a full backup of a device including text messages, notes, mail, browser history, etc.
* **RecoveryTool**, communicates with and boots a device out of Recovery Mode.
* **opensn0w**, a jailbreak for all limera1n devices.
* **libimobiledeviceinstaller**, installs one of the most important libraries for iOS developing.
