# How it Started (Real Life)
I was in the seventh grade. At that point in my life I never fit into a clique of kids and tried to force my way into other cliques, ultimately getting unwanted attention, bullying, and being more ostracized than I was to begin with. Without being in any real friend groups and feeling as though no one liked me, I struggled for a while with self-harm, depressive, and suicidal thoughts. I thought that if I were to die, who would really care besides my parents. The only reason I kept going to the next day is because I only had two close friends, Keaton and Collin. I rode the bus every morning with Keaton, who is a grade above me. Keaton was kind of into technology and had the brand new iPhone 5. At the time I had a flip phone. I finally got an iPhone 5 at Christmas that year. Keaton and I shared apps on the way to and from school everyday. One day, in February of 2013, he got on the bus and I noticed something different about his phone. His app icons acted in a strange manner making designs switching from page to page. I immediately had him explain what a jailbreak was. I was told it was a way to customize. After proving to my parents the legality of it I finally jailbroke that March. To be honest, I was scared at first, as I am sure everyone is. I hesitated because I was afraid of the unknown, but Keaton walked me through the process of using evasi0n. It was iOS 6.1.2. I immediately began to theme, tweak, and get really cool apps from Cydia. At the time, thats all I knew how to do. I was up all night the day I jailbroke, downloading tweaks, themes, and apps. Now, instead of sharing apps, Keaton and I shared tweaks and themes. 
	
Skip forward to August, 2014 and I hear about this thing called beta testing. We were in a restaurant and my parents got to talking to one of their friends, so I talked to their son. His phone was different than mine. It was so bright and flat looking. Turns out, he was beta testing iOS 7. I instantly wanted that and worked out in my mind that iOS 7 would be better than a jailbroken iOS 6.1.2. I got home that night and had him walk me through the process of downloading the iPSW and registering my UDID. By that time, I had a Twitter, but I hardly ever used it. By November, there was still no word from the evad3rs about a jailbreak for iOS 7. I was what you would call ambitious. I told myself that I was tired of waiting on the evad3rs, so I would just make my own jailbreak. I did some research and didn't exactly come up with much. 

By December, when the evad3rs released evasi0n7, I immediately jailbroke and put the research to the side. By that time, I was in seventh grade computer class. My teacher was Mr. Pryor. He seemed really cool, so I started staying after class and continuing to work on the computers until it was time for the bus to leave. Mr. Pryor supported me in everything I did. He gave me an iPhone 3GS that he found on the soccer field that was in pieces. He told me that I might like to take it up as a project to fix. I took it home and began to work on it without any guide whatsoever. I of course, messed it up. My mom told me about this guy named Josh who she knew that fixed devices. She took me over to his house and he gave me a bunch of tools to get started. Even he, however, admitted that the phone was going to be impossible to fix at that point. From that point on, I started to fix iPhones, iPods, computers, and iPads (which is my least favorite device to fix). I had finally found my niche.

Back to Mr. Pryor: I began to use class time to jailbreak other people using evasi0n. I stopped having his class after winter break because it was only a semester class. Now, after school I would stop by the technology center and have him show me cool tricks and troubleshooting techniques on computers. He is not really an Apple kind of guy. He only started getting interested in Apple because I would work on devices after school and show him cool jailbreak tweaks. I got into UNIX systems in the 8th grade because I read that the evad3rs used a utility called libimobiledevice to get backups using mobilebackup2. I only read that it was used on Linux, so naturally, 8th grade me thought I might was well install a really sketchy looking Linux distro called Santoku with libimobiledevice preinstalled because at the time I hardly knew what apt was. I also got my first Macbook Air in 8th grade because we started using e-textbooks at our school. I eventually figured out about MacPorts and then finally homebrew and then found you could basically install packages just like on UNIX systems. I soon got into Github and open-source projects. I made more frequent visits to the technology center in 8th grade and noticed that another guy, a senior named Alex, was sometimes in there. He was very into UNIX systems, so we became friends quickly. He told me about a program called the tech crew that met every day after school. Tech crew was in charge of all the technical aspects for the drama department, performing arts, and other speeches and presentations. Collin and I joined tech crew. I had become closer to Collin because Keaton was in high school and usually sat at the back of the bus studying or doing homework. After winter break, there was a new student, Griffin, who was really cool to me and we also soon became friends. By high school, he turned out to be one of my best friends. He's really funny and I was still somewhat struggling with depressive thoughts and is actually one of the few people who actually care (or act like he does) about the things I do with iOS. He was also one of the first people to ever acknowledge me as a "hacker" and people still seem to refer to me as a hacker at school. 

One incident I thought was funny is one that started after I bought my first testing device, an iPhone 3G. I was testing openiBoot on it and sent a picture of it running to a group chat. Turns out, a parent of one of the people in the group chat saw the picture and immediately contacted the school reporting me for "illegal hacking" and said that if this doesn't get resolved she may have to call the police. This ended up in a conversation that Mr. Pryor had to have with the entire Middle School about the difference between legal hacking and malicious hacking. 

Anyway, eighth grade passed and Alex went off to college. The summer between 8th grade and 9th grade was very fun as I spent most of the time either working on iDevices or watching Supernatural and Doctor Who. I went back to school for 9th grade to find out I had two free periods every day. That meant more time in the technology department. Since Alex was gone, there was an extra space for another computer. So I got my own spot in the technology department with a Windows 7, Ubuntu, and OS X machine. I began to help teachers and students out more and figured out some cool things about devices in recovery mode. Ever since ninth grade I have not done much that has made an impact in the world around me, but however, the world on the Internet is a different story.

# My Journey Online
I joined Twitter back in April of 2013. I didn't know what I was going to plan on doing with it, so it basically just sat there and I never paid much attention to it until I realized the potential of it. Here was a social media that I could use to get into contact with almost anyone in the world, including jailbreakers. I later created a Github where at first I mostly forked things just to save them and wrote shell scripts (yes I was a script kiddie). Then, one day I took my first step towards communicating with one of my mentors, iH8sn0w. I tweeted him and asked him how I should get started hacking and he gave me [a link](http://winocm.moe/research/2013/09/20/resources-for-getting-started/) to winocm's site. I was so excited that he replied to me because he didn't have to, but he did so because he wanted to help out. Also you may notice my site looks like winocm's because we have the same theme. I really like the theme she used.. Anyway, I soon got more comfortable with asking questions. Around the beginning of the year I emailed geohot. He is one of the most renowned iOS hackers of all time. I emailed him asking him for advice and references he could point me to to get started. I wasn't expecting a response, but I got one. He actually ended up not giving me any hacking advice, but more of some life lessons that I still carry on with and use today. One of which is asking the right questions. You are not going to get a good answer when asking "How do I hack iOS?". Another is that hacking is about asking questions and getting answers. But, it is about asking yourself the question and finding the answer yourself. That's where you discover the true beauty of hacking. But it is not bad to ask other's questions on topics you are not sure of, or there is little documentation. I began to talk with iH8sn0w a lot on Twitter every few weeks or so. I read winocm's blog posts over and over, understanding more each time I read. I often visited her Github page and then traveling from hers, to others and learning the true value of open-source. I also found a lot of cool tools on Github. I also began to get to know other hackers who are really amazing people who have helped me along the way. At the time of writing this, I recently [posted a picture](https://twitter.com/daytonhasty/status/581534406277537793) of me running one of winocm's tools on an iPhone 5 iBoot image. It turns out that the tools are not updated to be used with the iPhone 5 on iOS 8.2. Soon after posting it I got a notification on my phone telling me that iH8sn0w had retweeted the post. A few seconds later my phone was blowing up with favorites, retweets, and followers. After it had died down, I checked to see if I knew anyone who had followed me, and it turns out, winocm herself followed me. Two of my dreams came true: iH8sn0w recognizing me and liking the work enough to retweet it, and wincom, one of the best hackers and my first mentor, followed me. 

# Conclusion
It has truly been an amazing experience with all of you. Looking back on where I started and where I am now is stunning. I do not plan on stopping anytime soon and hope to further my knowledge in iOS devices in the coming future. Who knows what will happen! The last day of school before spring break I was just planning on asking winocm a question on Twitter and then watching Parks and Rec for the rest of the day. But apparently there was a different course the day took. I'm just glad I will be here to see how everything plays out.
